# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

This project is a collection of Python tasks focused on teaching you the principles of test-driven development (TDD) and improving your Python programming skills. Each task has specific learning objectives and requirements to fulfill.

## Project Information
- Author: Guillaume
- Weight: 1
- Project Start Date: Oct 26, 2023, 5:00 AM
- Project End Date: Nov 1, 2023, 4:00 AM
- Checker Released: Nov 1, 2023, 4:00 AM
- Auto Review Will Be Launched at the Deadline

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases
- Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Background Context
Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects:
Starting from today:
- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
- Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
