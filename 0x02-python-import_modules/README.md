# 0x02. Python - import & modules

Python Import and Modules Project

## Description

This project contains a series of Python tasks that involve importing functions from modules, working with command line arguments, and performing various calculations. The project aims to improve your understanding of Python programming concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

	git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

	cd 0x02-python-import_modules


3. Each task is in a separate Python script file. You can run them individually by executing the following command:

	python3 <script_name.py>


4. Make sure to meet the requirements and guidelines specified in the project description.

## Tasks

- [Task 0: Import a simple function from a simple file](./0-import_add.py)
- [Task 1: My first toolbox!](./1-calculation.py)
- [Task 2: How to make a script dynamic!](./2-args.py)
- [Task 3: Infinite addition](./3-infinite_add.py)
- [Task 4: Who are you?](./4-hidden_discovery.py)
- [Task 5: Everything can be imported](./5-variable_load.py)
- [Task 6: Build my own calculator!](./100-my_calculator.py)
- [Task 7: Easy print](./101-easy_print.py)
- [Task 8: ByteCode -> Python #3](./102-magic_calculation.py)
- [Task 9: Fast alphabet](./103-fast_alphabet.py)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code formatting
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file is mandatory
- Your code should be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you will be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome
- Import functions from another file
- Use imported functions
- Create a module
- Use the built-in function `dir()`
- Prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- Use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Copyright and Plagiarism

Plagiarism is strictly forbidden. You are required to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself. Do not copy and paste someone else's work. Any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.
