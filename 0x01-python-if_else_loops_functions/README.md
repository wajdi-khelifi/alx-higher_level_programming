Introduction

- This project is a collection of Python scripts and a C function implementation, focusing on learning and practicing various programming concepts. The scripts and functions are designed to cover a range of topics, including control flow, loops, functions, and more. The project also includes a technical interview preparation question.

Tasks
- This project consists of several tasks, each with its own set of objectives. Here is a brief overview of the tasks:

1. Positive Anything is Better than Negative Nothing: A Python script that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

2. The Last Digit: A Python script that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints the last digit of that number.

3. Print the Alphabet: A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase.

4. Print the Alphabet Without 'q' and 'e': A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'q' and 'e'.

5. Hexadecimal Printing: A Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

6. 00...99: A Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 99 with proper formatting.

7. Is Lower?: A Python function that checks if a character is lowercase.

8. To Uppercase: A Python function that prints a string in uppercase.

9. Print Last Digit: A Python function that prints the last digit of a number.

10. Add Two Integers: A Python function that adds two integers.

11. Power of a Number: A Python function that computes a number raised to a power.

12. Fizz Buzz: A Python function that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific conditions.

13. Insert in Sorted Linked List: A C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

14. Print Reverse Alphabet: A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.

15. Remove at Position: A Python function that creates a copy of a string with a character removed at a specified position.

16. ByteCode -> Python #2: A Python function that replicates the behavior of a given Python bytecode.

Requirements

- The project has specific requirements for both Python and C scripts. Here are some key requirements:

	- For Python scripts, use Python 3.8.5.
	- Use specific editors for Python and C scripts.
	- Follow style guidelines and use pycodestyle for Python scripts.
	- Ensure the correctness and functionality of your code.

Usage

- Each task is provided in a separate file or function, and they can be run individually or tested as needed. You can execute the Python scripts or compile and run the C code accordingly.

For example, to run a Python script:
	- $ python3 script_name.py

To compile and run a C program:

	- $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c file_name.c -o executable_name
	- $ ./executable_name
