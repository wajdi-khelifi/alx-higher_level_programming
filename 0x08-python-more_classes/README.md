## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why classes and objects are important in Python
- How to define a class
- What are attributes and methods in a class
- How to create and initialize objects from a class
- How to define and use class constructors
- How to implement inheritance in Python
- How to use class properties and class methods
- Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Background Context
[Provide any relevant background information about the project or the topics covered in the tasks]

## Resources
Read or watch:
- [Object-Oriented Programming(Read everything until the paragraph "inheritance")](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)
- [Object-Oriented Programming(Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](https://python-course.eu/oop/class-instance-attributes.php)
- [classmethods and saticmethods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M&ab_channel=CoreySchafer)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php)
- [str vs repr](https://shipit.dev/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html)

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
