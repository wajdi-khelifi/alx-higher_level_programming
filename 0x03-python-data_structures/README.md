# Project Title

Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Introduction

This project is a part of the [ALX Higher Level Programming](https://github.com/alx-higher-level-programming) curriculum. It focuses on Python programming and covers various aspects of data structures, specifically lists and tuples.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you should follow the instructions provided in the project tasks. Each task has its own requirements and objectives, and you should complete them in order to meet the learning objectives of this project.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Code editors: vi, vim, emacs

### Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each with its own Python script file. The tasks are as follows:

- [Task 0: Print a list of integers](./0-print_list_integer.py)
- [Task 1: Secure access to an element in a list](./1-element_at.py)
- [Task 2: Replace element in a list](./2-replace_in_list.py)
- [Task 3: Print a list of integers... in reverse!](./3-print_reversed_list_integer.py)
- [Task 4: Replace in a copy](./4-new_in_list.py)
- [Task 5: Remove characters from a string](./5-no_c.py)
- [Task 6: Lists of lists = Matrix](./6-print_matrix_integer.py)
- [Task 7: Tuples addition](./7-add_tuple.py)
- [Task 8: More returns!](./8-multiple_returns.py)
- [Task 9: Find the max](./9-max_integer.py)
- [Task 10: Only by 2](./10-divisible_by_2.py)
- [Task 11: Delete at](./11-delete_at.py)
- [Task 12: Switch](./12-switch.py)
- [Task 13: Linked list palindrome](./13-is_palindrome)
- [Task 14: CPython #0: Python lists (Advanced)](./100-print_python_list_info.c)

Each task has its own Python script file and specific requirements. Please refer to the individual task directories for more details.

## Usage

To run the Python scripts for each task, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the task directory (e.g., `0x03-python-data_structures/0-print_list_integer`).
2. Run the script using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code formatting
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file is mandatory
- Your code should be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Copyright and Plagiarism

Plagiarism is strictly forbidden. You are required to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself. Do not copy and paste someone else's work. Any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.
