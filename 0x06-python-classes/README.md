## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Understanding the concept of "first-class everything"
- What is a class and an object (or instance)
- Differentiating between a class and an object (or instance)
- What is an attribute
- How to use public, protected, and private attributes
- The role of `self` in Python classes
- Understanding methods in Python classes
- The significance of the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- Understanding Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- Differentiating between an attribute and a property in Python
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- Binding attributes to objects and classes
- Exploring the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what it contains
- How Python finds the attributes of an object or class
- Using the `getattr` function
